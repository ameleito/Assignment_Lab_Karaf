<h1>Purpuse</h1>

This repository contains the projects and tools to resolve the assignment homework for Advanced Camel Development with  Red Hat Fuse course, 
of course we include a complete description about how to clone, make de deploy in a fabric environment and we got another option is build 
another projects for spring-boot, but in this first part we discuss about how to make de deploy in a fabric container with deploy in the root container.

<h1>Request</h1>

For this work we need a fabric running, we test our development with Jboss Fuse 6.3 this one will be suggested to have the same behavior without issues,
we need this instalation with access to repository local like maven, of course this option is configurable inside the profile default making the medification
inside the file io.fabric8.agent.properties search the parameter org.ops4j.pax.url.mvn.defaultRepositories and org.ops4j.pax.url.mvn.repositories and we put
the way you must have these parameters defined.

org.ops4j.pax.url.mvn.defaultRepositories= \
	file:${user.home}/.m2/repository@snapshots@id=local, \
    file:${runtime.home}/${karaf.default.repository}@snapshots@id=karaf-default, \
    file:${runtime.data}/maven/upload@snapshots@id=fabric-upload, \
    file:${user.home}/.m2/repository@snapshots@id=local

org.ops4j.pax.url.mvn.repositories= \
	file:${user.home}/.m2/repository@snapshots@id=local, \
    http://repo1.maven.org/maven2@id=maven.central.repo, \
    https://maven.repository.redhat.com/ga@id=redhat.ga.repo, \
    https://maven.repository.redhat.com/earlyaccess/all@id=redhat.ea.repo, \
    https://repository.jboss.org/nexus/content/groups/ea@id=fuseearlyaccess


The other Requirement is have a postman installed to use the request you will find in the file AssigmentCamel.json

<h1>Step by Step</h1>

<h2>1. cloning</h2>

	Obviously the first option here will be get or clone our repo for this option we need to execute the next command.

	git clone https://github.com/ameleito/Assignment_Lab_Karaf.git

<h2>2. Import profile </h2>

	To enable the bundles insede fabric we have to follow the next steps.

<<<<<<< HEAD
	2.1 connect to fabric.

		<FUSE_HOME>/bin/client

	2.2 import profile with command:
=======
	<h3>2.1 connect to fabric.</h3>

		<FUSE_HOME>/bin/client

	<h3>2.2 import profile with command:</h3>
>>>>>>> 2119067736cf9b487ad6696e2a5b29e14c2453fb

		profile-import --version <version_fabric> file:///<Repository_Home>/assigmentLab.zip

		example:

		profile-import --version 1.0 file:///home/jamezqui/testProject/Assignment_Lab_Karaf/assigmentLab.zip

		the result for this command will be something like:

		Imported profiles into version 1.0

<<<<<<< HEAD
	2.3 Verifing the profile in fabric, to do that we will use the command:
=======
	<h3>2.3 Verifing the profile in fabric, to do that we will use the command:</h3>
>>>>>>> 2119067736cf9b487ad6696e2a5b29e14c2453fb

		profile-list |grep -i assigmentLab

		the reesult must be something like.

		assigmentLab                     1               default feature-camel mq-amq

<h2>3. 	Install the projects inside your maven local repository.</h2>

	We need to create our artifacts inside the repository where fabric load the artifactories, for us is a local maven. we need to execute the command mvn clean install 
	inside the next projects.

		artifacts
		services/mq-service/
		inbound
		xlate
		outbound

	when the resource will be enable inside our repository, we will ready to make the deploy.	 

<h2>4.  Deploying your profile.</h2>

	When you have your profile inside your fabric and all the projects inside your local repository, it's time to make the link beetwen container and profile this task
	will validate, will download, and will build the bundles inside the container the commands to do this are:

<<<<<<< HEAD
	4.1 Connect to fabric

		<FUSE_HOME>/bin/client

	4.2 Assotiate Profile to Container

		container-add-profile root  assigmentLab

	Verifing your assotiation
=======
	<h3>4.1 Connect to fabric</h3>

		<FUSE_HOME>/bin/client

	<h3>4.2 Assotiate Profile to Container</h3>

		container-add-profile root  assigmentLab

	<h3>Verifing your assotiation</h3>
>>>>>>> 2119067736cf9b487ad6696e2a5b29e14c2453fb

		container-list 

		This command show you the result as:

		 AviancaDev  1.0        karaf   yes          default                 success           
                                              		 assigmentLab                   


    In this way we can see the root container AviancaDev with the assigmentLab profile deploy inside the container.

<h2>5. Runing the Postman Test </h2>

	First you need to import the file AssignmentCamel.json inside Postman.

	Finally you can run the request PostSendData.

<h2>6. Another Works</h2>

	For this course we generated the same routes but for Spring-boot, this routes are available in the next repository
	<a href="https://github.com/ameleito/Assignment_Lab.git">projects for Spring-boot</a>, you can check them and 
	make the comments about it.
